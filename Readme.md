## Jppbash's Notes
Welcome to this repository where it has all my notes regarding my cybersecurity learnings and journey from official and known platforms such as ISC2, Hack the Box, etc.

There is something important that you need to have in consideration.

* This notes are meant to share what I understand from different training platforms as well as providers
* The notes you make the decision to download, you are more than welcome to use them but it does not mean they are going to be the only source for you to study in order to get certified
* You can have them as baselines to add additional notes when you start training on your own

Hope you enjoy the best. This is going to be a project I am going to be working on for the rest of the next years and hopefully you might find it useful.
